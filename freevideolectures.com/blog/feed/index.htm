				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online courses are, without a doubt, provides a great opportunity to learn anything, anywhere &amp; anytime. There are plenty of course providers like <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=u2QlXTouHn4&amp;mid=39197&amp;u1=guidepost&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2F">Udemy</a>, edX, Coursera, Udacity, Linux Foundation, FutureLearn, Skillshare, etc… As the number of these provider grow, so is confusion on which one to choose, here is a simple guide on how to choose online courses.</p>
<p>It is not feasible for everyone to join a top university like Harvard, MIT, IIT&#8217;s, Stanford etc. in terms of both economically &amp; physically. Online courses make it possible. Quality courses to everyone at fraction of the actual cost with certification.</p>
<h1>How to choose a course provider ?</h1>
<p>Most of the online course providers can be categorized into three different types.</p>
<ol>
<li>By Universities or organizations on platforms like <a href="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/130-nptel-iit-online-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPTEL</a>, edX, Coursera, Udacity &amp; FutureLearn by Harvard, MIT, Stanford University, Michigan university, IIT&#8217;s, IIM&#8217;s and organizations like Facebook, Google &amp; Microsoft.</li>
<li>By training companies or individual trainers on platforms like Udemy, Skillshare, Plural insight, Masterclass etc&#8230;</li>
<li>By training companies like intellipaat, simplilearn, edureka, TreeHousee tc..</li>
</ol>
<h2>Coursera, edX, Udacity and FutureLearn:</h2>
<p>Whereas courses on edX, Coursera, FutureLearn are developed by various universities like Harvard, Stanford and Big corporate giants like Google, Facebook and Microsoft.</p>
<p>These courses are delivered by university professors, who usually teaches in-depth basics to build a solid foundation towards research &amp; development and less of job oriented. Course contains recorded <a href="https://freevideolectures.com/">video tutorials</a> to watch &amp; learn at your speed.</p>
<p>Though most of the course material is free to access, you are asked to pay some fee to gain access to exercises, practice quizzes &amp; for certifications; Paid Students are given access to discussion forum to discussion with other students.</p>
<p>Across the globe many companies started recognizing these certifications. You can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/3-ways-list-moocs-your-linkedin-profile-joris-schut/">add these certifications in your LinkedIn&nbsp; profile as well</a>.</p>
<p>Few universities are accepting these courses are part of their regular college courses for credits as well. Ex: <a href="http://www.apu.apus.edu/lp2/general/MOOC/index.htm">American Public university gives credits to students</a> who takes the below coursera or Udacity courses.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-89234" src="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mooc_uniersity_credit.png" alt="courses with free certifications" width="572" height="371" srcset="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mooc_uniersity_credit.png 310w, https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mooc_uniersity_credit-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /></p>
<h3>Udemy, Skillhare, Plural insight, Masterclass:</h3>
<p>Trainers on these websites are individuals who mastered a skill or an art, providing lessons on how they mastered it &amp; how you can apply the same tips, techniques.</p>
<p>Udemy is one of the oldest of these, providing lot of quality courses at really low-cost. Cost that is less than a meal, no matter which part of the world you are from these courses are affordable&nbsp;!!</p>
<p>These courses are more of getting you ready for the job. Making you from beginners to Advanced what you need to know, understand &amp; teach &amp; start working, nothing more.</p>
<p>These providers will have forums where learners can post a doubts/queries to trainers and to discuss among themselves. You will not have immediate access to trainer.</p>
<p>Courses contains pre-recorded video lectures/tutorials to learn at your own pace &amp; convenient time.</p>
<h2>intellipaat, simplilearn, edureka:</h2>
<p>These are privately owned organizations/companies, who choose few trainers and offer courses. They offer both LIVE classes &amp; self-paced courses.</p>
<p>Courses are little expensive compared to other course providers but few of them organizations provide Job guarantee, virtual lab access, 24&#215;7 support, lot of mock interview practice sessions etc..</p>
<p>Most of the courses offered by these organisations are completely job oriented programs, which helps you get a job quicker, perform better at your current job.</p>
<h2>Live Vs Recorded (Self-Paced ) Courses:</h2>
<p>Great advantage with most of the online courses (Self-paced) is opportunity to learn anywhere &amp; any time. The main disadvantage is lack of immediate access to instructor/trainer to get your doubts clarified. This can be surmounted by joining LIVE training courses, where instructor teaches courses live, you can immediately ask a doubt.</p>
<p>With self-paced courses there is always a chance of procrastination to learn but this is not possible with LIVE courses.&nbsp; LIVE courses pushes you to take courses on time every session as per the planned scheduled time, helps you stick to your learning goals.</p>
<h1>How do you choose a course ?</h1>
<p>Assuming you have chosen one of the course provider with the information above. Now lets look into how to identify a suitable course for you.</p>
<h2>Course Contents/Syllabus</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to look at is what are the topics covered in that particular course. Course description &amp; table of contents give you complete idea of what is going to be covered.</p>
<h2>Ratings &amp; Reviews</h2>
<p>Ratings are something we always looks for while purchasing something online, online courses are no exception. But how reliable are these ratings ??</p>
<p>I request you to choose online courses with more numbers enrollment and ratings. Also read couple of reviews of previous students. This give you a lot of information.</p>
<h2>Quality (Money back Guarantee )/Trial periods</h2>
<p>Next thing you need to check is if the course provider offers any trial period or money back guarantee !! This is extremely important because if the course doesn&#8217;t add any value to you, you can ask for refund !!</p>
<ul>
<li>Udemy offers 30-day money back guarantee ! No matter the reason</li>
<li>Coursera offers 7-day free trial</li>
<li>SkillShare offers 30-day free trial</li>
<li>TreeHouse offers 14-day trail period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other course providers offer partial payment back. You can check it while enrolling !!</p>
<h2>Cost: Free Vs Paid courses</h2>
<p>With so many FREE courses available, why should someone join a PAID course?</p>
<p>Free courses are usually mainly targeted for beginners, who would like to know what is this topic is all about. With free courses,&nbsp; students would not have access to quizzes, assignments, discussion forums or any other technical support.</p>
<p>Free Courses do not help intermediate or Advanced learners who knows basics of the topic &amp; looking to go next level. You might find few new concepts, they are not really worth your time.</p>
<p>So if you are a beginner go for FREE courses else go for PAID courses.</p>
<h2>Certification Vs No certification</h2>
<p>On your resume, certification conveys a little more information than your knowledge.</p>
<p>Certification not only indicates about new skills you learned, it also tells your commitment I&nbsp; completing a course in-time i.e. sticking to the course deadlines to complete assignments for the entire course duration &amp; getting enough marks to get a grade or certification.</p>
<p>Mere joining a course and going through course material is not enough to master a skill or to crack an interview. I always recommend you to go for certification. Most of these are really low-cost.</p>
<h2>Things to Remember:</h2>
<p>Finally, please keep these two points in mind before you commit to a course.</p>
<h3>Time Vs Money :</h3>
<p>It is not money that you would lose, you will lose time if the course is not opt for you. If you are in Intermediate or Advanced stage learner, joining FREE courses might result in losing your valuable time. Time wise be-wise.</p>
<p>Do NOT join same course across multiple platforms. It would only waste your time.</p>
<h3>You need a Mentor :</h3>
<p>Every champion or every great leader had a mentor at some point of time in their life. Mentor-ship speeds up your learning, helps you in making fewer mistakes, keeps you stay focused &amp; on your track. Learning on your own is also a good way, but that takes a lot of time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have selected 101 FREE online courses with certificates to learn in 2018. These are all top rated courses from Udemy, Coursera, edX &amp; other course providers. Though Coursera &amp; edX charges for certification, course material is absolutely free for all.</p>
<h2>Does Online certification by Udemy, edX or Coursera has any significance or value ?</h2>
<p>Yes, Certification is extremely helpful when you are applying for jobs &amp; higher education.</p>
<p>Getting certified either online or offline involves going through course material, tutorials, quizzes and submitting assignments in time. Completing assignments &amp; getting them verified to meet the pass criteria is an indication of your level of learning.</p>
<p>This also shows your willingness to learn new things and commitment to complete the courses though there are no academic grades here.</p>
<p>When it comes to the case of job interviews, certification gets you a good impression in the eyes of interviewer. If they have to choose one among two equally qualifies candidates, one with certification and other candidate without any certification, there is a high chance that the person with certification get priority.</p>
<p>Merely enrolling a course and reviewing the course contents is not enough. It doesn&#8217;t really indicate anything.</p>
<h2>Improve English &amp; Communication Skills</h2>
<p>Communication skills plays an crucial role in understanding &amp; presenting your views. No matter how good you are, there is always room for improving communication skills.</p>
<p>These courses helps you in improving your oral, written (including grammar), business English.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Online Learning- Flourishing</strong></p>
<p>With the birth of online learning in the 80’s, it has drastically changed the training industry and is showing rapid progress and evolution.</p>
<p>Thousands of free online courses are offered by universities like MITOCW, MOOC providers like edX, Coursera, FutureLearn and NovoEd.</p>
<p>Organizations prefer online training and development courses for their staff to save massively on cost and time, and at the same time sharpen their skill-sets. Fortune 500 firms organized 73.6% of their technology-delivered training through online methods (workforce.com). 28.1% revenue (that is $56.2 billion out of the total $200 billion) of the corporate training industry comes from eLearning (Global Industry Analysts).</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Though online learning is totally different from traditional classroom training in terms of attending classes and interacting with trainers &amp; students, it is no different when it comes to actual learning. It comes with its own challenges in the time of distraction. Either you are a beginner or advanced learner, there are few things which should be avoided while learning online to get maximum benefit out of it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enrolling without Complete Info: </strong>A common mistake made by students, sometimes even by professionals, is to enroll, just because someone referred or is pursuing that certification. You must not do this, as your goal, caliber, knowledge; future plans for career progression and affordability may or may not match with someone else’s. Even if you want to pursue a specific course you must go through the complete information on the course, match it with your needs, and verify its accreditation, market value and the support services they extend. There can be another academic advisor whose programs has a better marketability than yours.</li>
<li><strong>Wait or take things for granted: </strong>The beauty of the online ecosystem is that nobody is visible, so you must feel the presence and show your presence to your academic advisor. You must ask a lot of questions, doubts, information and queries. You must explore the possibilities and opportunities of finding answers from websites like stackoverflow, Quora and other forums as well. Another beauty of online learning is, flexibility in timings, you get your answers anytime, any day even midnight.</li>
<li><strong>Surrender to Procrastination:</strong> Chances of developing procrastination are quite high unless you have a fixed scheduled time every day, just like a traditional classroom hours. This makes you stick to the plan &amp; develop a habit of persistence as well. Along with having a scheduled time, you also need to make sure you turn off notifications on phone especially social media notifications. Plan your day and schedule your study time so that you do not stay behind.</li>
<li><strong>Feel alone: </strong>It is usually felt that when you are learning online you are alone. The fact is you are not alone, but have hundreds and thousands of similar people doing the course, instructors and advisors. The benefits of interacting with others is, you get new information, share ideas, concepts and grasp concepts faster. When you do not do you miss learning new and innovative things. Try to socialize in this environment to learn better and faster. Do not limit yourself; explore things, people, groups who can enrich your online learnings. This is also a way by which you can resolve or clarify and question or query.</li>
<li><strong>Do Not Celebrate: </strong>People get bored and lose interest slowly while learning online. The Very common reason behind it is they do not celebrate their accomplishments. You must celebrate your achievements, even if they are small, like finishing a chapter which you felt was quite lengthy and tough. Like how you managed to complete a field activity, without hampering your daily official responsibilities. All these will keep you motivated and you will elevate your mood and rejuvenate yourself. In the ecosystem of online learning, the possibilities of getting praised are very minuscule.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your decision to opt for an e-learning course can get you dividends only when the direction chosen is correct and you follow the order. Your sense of commitment, time-management, self motivation and temperament are the key to learn things faster, smoother and adapt to learning online effectively. You just must align all these to the online learning ecosystem.</p>

<p>Intense learning is a progressively more admired category of AI (artificial intelligence). Speaking, in general, it entails guiding artificial neural systems on heaps of data — for instance images — and acquiring them to create inferences regarding fresh data founded on what they understand.</p>
<p>One of Google’s chief scientists and technological head of the Google’s Brain team, Vincent Vanhoucke, is instructing the program, which is an element of Udacity’s Nanodegree course for machine learning engineer. The team presses forward the organization’s core intense learning expertise, which can be utilized within numerous Google products.</p>
<p>Undeniably, Google utilizes intense learning in a lot of of its applications, counting, Inbox by Gmail, Google Voice Search, Google Translate and Google Photos.</p>
<p>In November, Google launched<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/09/google-launches-open-source-machine-learning-system-tensorflow/"> TensorFlow</a>, a significant part of intense learning software offered by Google Brain team. Also, not surprisingly, the Udacity program will include TensorFlow, in addition to complex neural networks, continual neural networks, and long term and temporary memory networks, Vanhoucke cited in one of blog posts on the bulletin.</p>
<p>Vanhoucke mentioned that the overall objective of creating this program was to offer the machine learning aficionado a direct and quick path to resolving factual and fascinating problems with intense learning system, and they were extremely thrilled to share what they had created.</p>
<p>Just similar to TensorFlow software, the program is free of cost.</p>
<p>Udacity’s adversary Coursera provides a machine learning program from deep learning celebrity Andrew Ng (former member of Google Brain team).</p>
<p>Separately, Google stated in a blog post that roughly a million people have already registered for Google’s Developer Training programs offered through Udacity.</p>

<li><strong> Make Study Goals: </strong>The most essential foundation to studying effectively starts with setting study goals. You won’t know where you are headed if don’t have any destination to reach. Set your goals. Set realistic goals. That are doable and yet challenging. Assess if you need to buck up to achieve them. If you are content with the goals, proceed to the next tip.</li>
<li><strong> Prepare Study Plan: </strong>Heard of, ‘failing to prepare is preparing to fail’. Unless you thrive on cramming the day before the exam, create an organised study plan to utilize your time effectively. You have goals to look forward to, so design a study schedule such that all subjects receive equal attention. Calculate the time you have in hand after school (or tuitions, if any) and divide it neatly into a plan accommodating study and practice time.</li>
<li><strong> Adopt Novel Technologies: </strong>The handwritten study technique holds immense importance for every student but one must explore other options of learning such as online tools and study apps. These novel technologies are user-centric and infuse fluidity in monotonous study regime. It would be better though, if you abstain from hogging social sites.</li>
<li><strong> Take breaks: </strong>Bear in mind, to maintain an adequate concentration level, you must take small breaks in between your study hours. Take a walk, hit the gym, call a friend or gulp some refreshing fluids. Taking breaks increases concentration and improves productivity. Remember to get back to studying once your break is over.</li>
<li><strong> Learn lessons like stories: </strong>Stories have the power of entertaining and teaching even the smallest details effortlessly. Apply this to studies by knitting main facts into a story. Make it ridiculous or compose acronyms to remember boring formulae.</li>
<li><strong> Positive attitude: </strong>Your learning process is as good as your attitude towards studies. If you’ve accepted that you can’t pull it off, committing to studies or attempting to learn is like fooling yourself. Instead, focus on your strengths and keep a positive attitude towards your goals. When students think positively, their brains display enhanced activity, thereby reducing their nervousness and exposing them to fresh ideas.</li>
<li><strong> Team study: </strong>If you keep company with mates who can motivate you to study well, then team study is a great idea. Not only will they encourage you, but help solve doubts or problems in case you get stuck. Also, our minds works better when faced with a competition and your team mates can be your best competitors. We are talking about a healthy competition here, not otherwise.</li>
<li><strong> Testing times: </strong>Even had a nightmare of forgetting all your hard learned concepts the moment you see the question paper. Nothing but timely revisions can take away the fear of going blank at the sight of examination hall. Beat the stress of remembering formulae, dates, names, and facts by testing yourself through quizzes. The more you revise and take regular tests, the better are your chances of faring well.</li>
<li><strong> Strike a Healthy Balance: </strong>Struggling to get enough sleep or losing out on nutrition! To study better, one has to strike a perfect balance between physical and mental strength. Next time your mom reminds you of eating on time, take her seriously. Eating right and apt will boost your mental vigour besides preparing you to endure exam stress and follow your study plan more effectively.</li>
<li><strong> Study location: </strong>Your study location must be quiet and away from distractions. You can try sitting at different places and see which one works for you.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Group Discussion (GD) is an important part of the selection process for admission to top business schools. Opinions and thoughts are exchanged and debated upon in a GD. The candidates are divided into groups and each group is assigned a subject for discussion. The idea behind GD is to assess leadership, communication, listening, interactive, analytical, and decision making skills of the candidate. Here are some<strong> top things that can make you perfect for the Group Discussion (GD):</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prepare well:</strong> More often than not, GDs are based on subjects like gender inequality, reservations in educational institutions, terrorism, poverty, privatization and liberalisation. Preparing these subjects before you appear for GD will give you an edge over others.</li>
<li><strong>Dress formally:</strong> Opt for formal and comfortable dressing for GD. No casual or fancy wear. Your dressing infuses positivity in your speaking that comes across quite evidently during the discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Initiate the discussion:</strong> Initiating the discussion is the perfect way to gain attention provided you have understood the subject properly and possess sufficient knowledge about it. Once you get the subject, note down points around which you would want to structure the debate. Setting off without understanding the subject is a big NO.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain eye contact:</strong> It is important to maintain an eye contact with your group members. This helps to form a connection between you and the members and also lets you put your points across more convincingly. Avoid gazing at the assessors while expressing your views.</li>
<li><strong>Be confident:</strong> Positive and confident demeanour is a must for GD. Your body language conveys a lot so maintain a positive stance and prove your interest in the subject. Avoid any attempt to dominate group members.</li>
<li><strong>Let other speak:</strong> Do not interject while others are speaking. Even though you disagree with their view, you must never interrupt. Instead, jot down points and clarify your opinion when your turn comes.</li>
<li><strong>Be simple and clear:</strong> Speak clearly and use simple and comprehensible words while talking. Express your opinion politely and calmly without turning aggressive in case you disagree with somebody.</li>
<li><strong>Steer the discussion on the right track:</strong> If the discussion has lost track or the group has digressed from the subject then steer the discussion on the right track. Ensure that members understand that you all must arrive at a conclusion to close the discussion so simply hold on to the subject.</li>
<li><strong>Talk logically:</strong> You must not fret about increasing your speaking duration. Even if you say less, just be relevant and sensible. Dragging your point and talking irrelevantly will not help.</li>
<li><strong>All ears to others:</strong> GD tests your listening skills too so make sure you listen more and speak less. Paying attention when other members are speaking will keep you involved in the discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid going into minutiae:</strong> It is sufficient to do a basic analysis of the subject but there is no need to quote exact data while making any reference. As GDs are time bound, keeping it simple and short will be just perfect. Your precise thoughts on the subject are more important rather than the minute details.</li>
<li><strong>Last man standing</strong>: Bringing the discussion to a conclusion and ending it is an added advantage. Try summarizing the discussion and articulate a conclusion that you and members arrived at.</li>
</ul>
<p>Succeeding in a GD is as important as clearing the competitive exam. With adequate control you can manoeuvre the discussion and reach to a conclusion. It’s just like driving a car! Hand on steering, push the accelerator and hit the brakes when needed.  Be the conscientious driver and drive the discussion in your stride.</p>
