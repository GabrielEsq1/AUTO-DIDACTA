				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online courses are, without a doubt, provides a great opportunity to learn anything, anywhere &amp; anytime. There are plenty of course providers like <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=u2QlXTouHn4&amp;mid=39197&amp;u1=guidepost&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2F">Udemy</a>, edX, Coursera, Udacity, Linux Foundation, FutureLearn, Skillshare, etc… As the number of these provider grow, so is confusion on which one to choose, here is a simple guide on how to choose online courses.</p>
<p>It is not feasible for everyone to join a top university like Harvard, MIT, IIT&#8217;s, Stanford etc. in terms of both economically &amp; physically. Online courses make it possible. Quality courses to everyone at fraction of the actual cost with certification.</p>
<h1>How to choose a course provider ?</h1>
<p>Most of the online course providers can be categorized into three different types.</p>
<ol>
<li>By Universities or organizations on platforms like <a href="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/130-nptel-iit-online-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPTEL</a>, edX, Coursera, Udacity &amp; FutureLearn by Harvard, MIT, Stanford University, Michigan university, IIT&#8217;s, IIM&#8217;s and organizations like Facebook, Google &amp; Microsoft.</li>
<li>By training companies or individual trainers on platforms like Udemy, Skillshare, Plural insight, Masterclass etc&#8230;</li>
<li>By training companies like intellipaat, simplilearn, edureka, TreeHousee tc..</li>
</ol>
<h2>Coursera, edX, Udacity and FutureLearn:</h2>
<p>Whereas courses on edX, Coursera, FutureLearn are developed by various universities like Harvard, Stanford and Big corporate giants like Google, Facebook and Microsoft.</p>
<p>These courses are delivered by university professors, who usually teaches in-depth basics to build a solid foundation towards research &amp; development and less of job oriented. Course contains recorded <a href="https://freevideolectures.com/">video tutorials</a> to watch &amp; learn at your speed.</p>
<p>Though most of the course material is free to access, you are asked to pay some fee to gain access to exercises, practice quizzes &amp; for certifications; Paid Students are given access to discussion forum to discussion with other students.</p>
<p>Across the globe many companies started recognizing these certifications. You can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/3-ways-list-moocs-your-linkedin-profile-joris-schut/">add these certifications in your LinkedIn&nbsp; profile as well</a>.</p>
<p>Few universities are accepting these courses are part of their regular college courses for credits as well. Ex: <a href="http://www.apu.apus.edu/lp2/general/MOOC/index.htm">American Public university gives credits to students</a> who takes the below coursera or Udacity courses.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-89234" src="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mooc_uniersity_credit.png" alt="courses with free certifications" width="572" height="371" srcset="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mooc_uniersity_credit.png 310w, https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mooc_uniersity_credit-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /></p>
<h3>Udemy, Skillhare, Plural insight, Masterclass:</h3>
<p>Trainers on these websites are individuals who mastered a skill or an art, providing lessons on how they mastered it &amp; how you can apply the same tips, techniques.</p>
<p>Udemy is one of the oldest of these, providing lot of quality courses at really low-cost. Cost that is less than a meal, no matter which part of the world you are from these courses are affordable&nbsp;!!</p>
<p>These courses are more of getting you ready for the job. Making you from beginners to Advanced what you need to know, understand &amp; teach &amp; start working, nothing more.</p>
<p>These providers will have forums where learners can post a doubts/queries to trainers and to discuss among themselves. You will not have immediate access to trainer.</p>
<p>Courses contains pre-recorded video lectures/tutorials to learn at your own pace &amp; convenient time.</p>
<h2>intellipaat, simplilearn, edureka:</h2>
<p>These are privately owned organizations/companies, who choose few trainers and offer courses. They offer both LIVE classes &amp; self-paced courses.</p>
<p>Courses are little expensive compared to other course providers but few of them organizations provide Job guarantee, virtual lab access, 24&#215;7 support, lot of mock interview practice sessions etc..</p>
<p>Most of the courses offered by these organisations are completely job oriented programs, which helps you get a job quicker, perform better at your current job.</p>
<h2>Live Vs Recorded (Self-Paced ) Courses:</h2>
<p>Great advantage with most of the online courses (Self-paced) is opportunity to learn anywhere &amp; any time. The main disadvantage is lack of immediate access to instructor/trainer to get your doubts clarified. This can be surmounted by joining LIVE training courses, where instructor teaches courses live, you can immediately ask a doubt.</p>
<p>With self-paced courses there is always a chance of procrastination to learn but this is not possible with LIVE courses.&nbsp; LIVE courses pushes you to take courses on time every session as per the planned scheduled time, helps you stick to your learning goals.</p>
<h1>How do you choose a course ?</h1>
<p>Assuming you have chosen one of the course provider with the information above. Now lets look into how to identify a suitable course for you.</p>
<h2>Course Contents/Syllabus</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to look at is what are the topics covered in that particular course. Course description &amp; table of contents give you complete idea of what is going to be covered.</p>
<h2>Ratings &amp; Reviews</h2>
<p>Ratings are something we always looks for while purchasing something online, online courses are no exception. But how reliable are these ratings ??</p>
<p>I request you to choose online courses with more numbers enrollment and ratings. Also read couple of reviews of previous students. This give you a lot of information.</p>
<h2>Quality (Money back Guarantee )/Trial periods</h2>
<p>Next thing you need to check is if the course provider offers any trial period or money back guarantee !! This is extremely important because if the course doesn&#8217;t add any value to you, you can ask for refund !!</p>
<ul>
<li>Udemy offers 30-day money back guarantee ! No matter the reason</li>
<li>Coursera offers 7-day free trial</li>
<li>SkillShare offers 30-day free trial</li>
<li>TreeHouse offers 14-day trail period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other course providers offer partial payment back. You can check it while enrolling !!</p>
<h2>Cost: Free Vs Paid courses</h2>
<p>With so many FREE courses available, why should someone join a PAID course?</p>
<p>Free courses are usually mainly targeted for beginners, who would like to know what is this topic is all about. With free courses,&nbsp; students would not have access to quizzes, assignments, discussion forums or any other technical support.</p>
<p>Free Courses do not help intermediate or Advanced learners who knows basics of the topic &amp; looking to go next level. You might find few new concepts, they are not really worth your time.</p>
<p>So if you are a beginner go for FREE courses else go for PAID courses.</p>
<h2>Certification Vs No certification</h2>
<p>On your resume, certification conveys a little more information than your knowledge.</p>
<p>Certification not only indicates about new skills you learned, it also tells your commitment I&nbsp; completing a course in-time i.e. sticking to the course deadlines to complete assignments for the entire course duration &amp; getting enough marks to get a grade or certification.</p>
<p>Mere joining a course and going through course material is not enough to master a skill or to crack an interview. I always recommend you to go for certification. Most of these are really low-cost.</p>
<h2>Things to Remember:</h2>
<p>Finally, please keep these two points in mind before you commit to a course.</p>
<h3>Time Vs Money :</h3>
<p>It is not money that you would lose, you will lose time if the course is not opt for you. If you are in Intermediate or Advanced stage learner, joining FREE courses might result in losing your valuable time. Time wise be-wise.</p>
<p>Do NOT join same course across multiple platforms. It would only waste your time.</p>
<h3>You need a Mentor :</h3>
<p>Every champion or every great leader had a mentor at some point of time in their life. Mentor-ship speeds up your learning, helps you in making fewer mistakes, keeps you stay focused &amp; on your track. Learning on your own is also a good way, but that takes a lot of time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To assist students looking forward to making the most of their learning time and achieving brilliant grades at school in the coming session, we composed a list of <strong>10 tips that can help your study better.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Make Study Goals: </strong>The most essential foundation to studying effectively starts with setting study goals. You won’t know where you are headed if don’t have any destination to reach. Set your goals. Set realistic goals. That are doable and yet challenging. Assess if you need to buck up to achieve them. If you are content with the goals, proceed to the next tip.</li>
<li><strong> Prepare Study Plan: </strong>Heard of, ‘failing to prepare is preparing to fail’. Unless you thrive on cramming the day before the exam, create an organised study plan to utilize your time effectively. You have goals to look forward to, so design a study schedule such that all subjects receive equal attention. Calculate the time you have in hand after school (or tuitions, if any) and divide it neatly into a plan accommodating study and practice time.</li>
<li><strong> Adopt Novel Technologies: </strong>The handwritten study technique holds immense importance for every student but one must explore other options of learning such as online tools and study apps. These novel technologies are user-centric and infuse fluidity in monotonous study regime. It would be better though, if you abstain from hogging social sites.</li>
<li><strong> Take breaks: </strong>Bear in mind, to maintain an adequate concentration level, you must take small breaks in between your study hours. Take a walk, hit the gym, call a friend or gulp some refreshing fluids. Taking breaks increases concentration and improves productivity. Remember to get back to studying once your break is over.</li>
<li><strong> Learn lessons like stories: </strong>Stories have the power of entertaining and teaching even the smallest details effortlessly. Apply this to studies by knitting main facts into a story. Make it ridiculous or compose acronyms to remember boring formulae.</li>
<li><strong> Positive attitude: </strong>Your learning process is as good as your attitude towards studies. If you’ve accepted that you can’t pull it off, committing to studies or attempting to learn is like fooling yourself. Instead, focus on your strengths and keep a positive attitude towards your goals. When students think positively, their brains display enhanced activity, thereby reducing their nervousness and exposing them to fresh ideas.</li>
<li><strong> Team study: </strong>If you keep company with mates who can motivate you to study well, then team study is a great idea. Not only will they encourage you, but help solve doubts or problems in case you get stuck. Also, our minds works better when faced with a competition and your team mates can be your best competitors. We are talking about a healthy competition here, not otherwise.</li>
<li><strong> Testing times: </strong>Even had a nightmare of forgetting all your hard learned concepts the moment you see the question paper. Nothing but timely revisions can take away the fear of going blank at the sight of examination hall. Beat the stress of remembering formulae, dates, names, and facts by testing yourself through quizzes. The more you revise and take regular tests, the better are your chances of faring well.</li>
<li><strong> Strike a Healthy Balance: </strong>Struggling to get enough sleep or losing out on nutrition! To study better, one has to strike a perfect balance between physical and mental strength. Next time your mom reminds you of eating on time, take her seriously. Eating right and apt will boost your mental vigour besides preparing you to endure exam stress and follow your study plan more effectively.</li>
<li><strong> Study location: </strong>Your study location must be quiet and away from distractions. You can try sitting at different places and see which one works for you.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Group Discussion (GD) is an important part of the selection process for admission to top business schools. Opinions and thoughts are exchanged and debated upon in a GD. The candidates are divided into groups and each group is assigned a subject for discussion. The idea behind GD is to assess leadership, communication, listening, interactive, analytical, and decision making skills of the candidate. Here are some<strong> top things that can make you perfect for the Group Discussion (GD):</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prepare well:</strong> More often than not, GDs are based on subjects like gender inequality, reservations in educational institutions, terrorism, poverty, privatization and liberalisation. Preparing these subjects before you appear for GD will give you an edge over others.</li>
<li><strong>Dress formally:</strong> Opt for formal and comfortable dressing for GD. No casual or fancy wear. Your dressing infuses positivity in your speaking that comes across quite evidently during the discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Initiate the discussion:</strong> Initiating the discussion is the perfect way to gain attention provided you have understood the subject properly and possess sufficient knowledge about it. Once you get the subject, note down points around which you would want to structure the debate. Setting off without understanding the subject is a big NO.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain eye contact:</strong> It is important to maintain an eye contact with your group members. This helps to form a connection between you and the members and also lets you put your points across more convincingly. Avoid gazing at the assessors while expressing your views.</li>
<li><strong>Be confident:</strong> Positive and confident demeanour is a must for GD. Your body language conveys a lot so maintain a positive stance and prove your interest in the subject. Avoid any attempt to dominate group members.</li>
<li><strong>Let other speak:</strong> Do not interject while others are speaking. Even though you disagree with their view, you must never interrupt. Instead, jot down points and clarify your opinion when your turn comes.</li>
<li><strong>Be simple and clear:</strong> Speak clearly and use simple and comprehensible words while talking. Express your opinion politely and calmly without turning aggressive in case you disagree with somebody.</li>
<li><strong>Steer the discussion on the right track:</strong> If the discussion has lost track or the group has digressed from the subject then steer the discussion on the right track. Ensure that members understand that you all must arrive at a conclusion to close the discussion so simply hold on to the subject.</li>
<li><strong>Talk logically:</strong> You must not fret about increasing your speaking duration. Even if you say less, just be relevant and sensible. Dragging your point and talking irrelevantly will not help.</li>
<li><strong>All ears to others:</strong> GD tests your listening skills too so make sure you listen more and speak less. Paying attention when other members are speaking will keep you involved in the discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid going into minutiae:</strong> It is sufficient to do a basic analysis of the subject but there is no need to quote exact data while making any reference. As GDs are time bound, keeping it simple and short will be just perfect. Your precise thoughts on the subject are more important rather than the minute details.</li>
<li><strong>Last man standing</strong>: Bringing the discussion to a conclusion and ending it is an added advantage. Try summarizing the discussion and articulate a conclusion that you and members arrived at.</li>
</ul>
<p>Succeeding in a GD is as important as clearing the competitive exam. With adequate control you can manoeuvre the discussion and reach to a conclusion. It’s just like driving a car! Hand on steering, push the accelerator and hit the brakes when needed.  Be the conscientious driver and drive the discussion in your stride.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Teachers and parents might perceive the Internet as the opponent of traditional books, but in reality the Internet complements the concept of reading books quite satisfactorily.</p>
<p>With numerous websites dedicated to education and reading, it becomes easier for children to bond with distant readers, gain insights about what they are studying, and find out additional books of importance. Furthermore, they present innovative ideas that teachers can share in their classroom.</p>
<p>Your children may perhaps start off a book group on the Internet, write reviews online, or make use of Internet to delve further about a preferred author. We compiled a list of ten of the topmost free websites related to reading that encourages young and old to read:</p>
<h2><b>1. Goodreads</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89254" src="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/goodreads.png" alt="good reads image" width="620" height="270" srcset="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/goodreads.png 620w, https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/goodreads-300x131.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>One of the leading reading websites on the Internet, Goodreads is an excellent tool for school students. It allows students to keep a record of books they have read or are reading and observe what their buddies are reading. &nbsp;The site also <strong>recommends books to readers on the basis of their reading preferences and kids</strong> can maintain a catalog of books that they wish to read. Goodreads does not consent children below 13 years to operate the site.</p>
<p>It is possible for teachers to create an exclusive group for class students to talk about books or compose book-related questionnaires for students. Many students like sharing online better than sharing in class and thus reading turns into a more active experience when several students start exchanging opinions with their each other.</p>
<p>Let students write a review for a book on the website or make quizzes on their own in relation to a topic they read.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">https://www.goodreads.com/</a></p>
<h2><b>2. Book Wizard</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89256" src="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/book-wizard-1.jpg" alt="free ebook website book wizard" width="574" height="286" srcset="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/book-wizard-1.jpg 574w, https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/book-wizard-1-300x149.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></p>
<p>Book Wizard from Scholastic is an all-inclusive web source for both teachers as well as students. It <strong>offers list of books by grade and subject, book critiques, and propose activities and tutorial ideas for books to students</strong>. The site enables students to peruse the writer segment in order to discover how their adored illustrators and authors embarked on their journey.</p>
<p>The search feature of Book Wizard is absolutely wonderful for librarians and teachers. Type in a book name and the site will automatically supply the synopsis, reading level, writer biography, and links to other free reading sources. You may also type in a name to seek out related books that are simpler or more sophisticated. Forward the website to parents so they can come upon appropriate books for their wards.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scholastic.com/bookwizard/">http://www.scholastic.com/bookwizard/</a></p>
<h2><b>3. Biblio Nasium</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89257" src="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Biblio-1024x638.png" alt="biblio images" width="1024" height="638" srcset="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Biblio-1024x638.png 1024w, https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Biblio-1024x638-300x187.png 300w, https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Biblio-1024x638-768x479.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>BiblioNasium is quite similar to Goodreads in the sense that it allows students to keep a track of books they read, other books they wish to read, and time spend on reading every day. The users can also check out what their buddies are reading. The readers can search books for their choice of genre, reading level, or a writer.</p>
<p>BiblioNasium is a superb means to motivate children to read. Teachers can utilize the site to post reading challenges to class students and even their parents. You can exploit the site to foster children to study books from a different genre or to add to the hours they devote on reading. To increase their interest, you can organize a challenge among classes to distinguish which can study extra books. Unlike other sites, BiblioNasium is open for younger readers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblionasium.com/">https://www.biblionasium.com/</a></p>
<h2><b>4. Common Sense Media</b></h2>
<p>Common Sense Media book catalogue is possibly the friendliest list that is available for the teachers. Spanning a catalogue for unenthusiastic readers as well as for fans of ghost tales, Common Sense Media picks premium books and catalogues texts based on age-appropriateness.

Kids from playgroup to 8th class can respond to questions for texts they already read, while teachers or parents review the answers. Students gain points for answering the questions correctly and inch closer to prizes. Teachers can trace the number of text books students read and check their performance at the quizzes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bookadventure.com/Home.aspx">http://www.bookadventure.com/Home.aspx</a></p>
<h2><b>6. Reading Rockets</b></h2>
<p>A site for nationwide literacy programme, <a href="http://www.readingrockets.org/">Reading Rockets</a> is filled with suggestions for reaching out to every kid in the class. The Children’s Books &amp; Authors segment contains the literacy almanac that offers a roster of holidays and reading festivals with links related to classroom activities, books, learning websites, and writer interviews. The videos for writer interviews are appealing, as kids’ beloved authors share anecdotes of personal experiences from their childhood.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readingrockets.org/">http://www.readingrockets.org/</a></p>
<h2><strong>7. Education.com</strong></h2>
<p>If you are looking out for some sort of inspiration, this website has just about everything. Discover reading indices by subject and grade level. It includes a plethora of activities and worksheets, a few of them linked to specific textbooks. The site has recently incorporated interactive texts, which allows young users to read or listen to the content themselves. Include this web source to your aural library to encourage young students to read independently.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.education.com/">http://www.education.com/</a></p>
<h2><b>8. Start With a Book</b></h2>
<p>A subsidiary of Reading Rockets, <a href="http://www.startwithabook.org/">Start With a Book</a> was formed to encourage children to engage in summertime reading, but it’s equally useful for teachers round the year. The web content is intended for primary school kids and prepared around 24 topics, like dinosaurs, oceans, the night sky, and craft.</p>
<p>You may utilize the site to change a read out segment into a chapter that comprises history and science content. Every themed segment contains an index of books, related links and websites for practical activities. You can even draw ideas for writing from the site.</p>
<p>The <strong>topics take in dinosaurs, craft, the night sky, and cookery</strong>. It is an impressive site to send on to the parents for summer vacation and school breaks so they can help kids develop reading habits.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.startwithabook.org/">http://www.startwithabook.org/</a></p>
<h2><strong>9. American Library Association&#8217;s Banned and Challenged Books</strong></h2>
<p>Even the reluctant readers find censorship interesting to read. This website talks about the First Amendment and prohibited books besides providing a list of the most disputed books. Let readers pick a book listed in the index and write an argument or challenge for the book on their own.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ala.org/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks">http://www.ala.org/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks</a></p>
<h2><strong>10. Jim Trelease on Reading</strong></h2>
<p>Educator and writer Jim Trelease maintains an online anthology of information that is perfect for librarians and teachers. Hit the link “Book Lists” for an assortment of fantastic recitation books.</p>
<p>The catalog embraces picture books, story books, fairy tales, poems, etc. The site offers page length and graded choices. This web tool is especially great for gathering books related to a theme. You can exhibit different books in your class library.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.trelease-on-reading.com/">http://www.trelease-on-reading.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Look beyond the book</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you imagine life without Internet? It’s pretty obvious, that the answer to this question will be a big NO. However, if you feel otherwise stop whatever you are doing for a minute, and just look around yourself. You will easily realize how this technology has become an integral part of your lifestyle. From phones to PC’s gaming consoles to television set-top-boxes, Internet is present in almost every aspect of modern living.</p>
<p><strong>The Internet Of Things – An Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This growing use of Internet in the everyday devices used both at home and at work that has led to the development of the term, “Internet Of Things”. The term was first coined in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, a British entrepreneur, while he was working at Auto-ID Labs, although the term became popular only after it was mentioned in an article in RFID Journal in 2009.</p>
<p>Put simply, the term refers to the ability of devices to connect with the Internet and even with each other, if the need be.  The devices can include anything from cell phones to washing machines and coffee makers to laptops and even wearable devices. These devices and gadgets can be fitted with sensors and connectivity technology to make them work together and even automatically to make our lives easier.</p>
<p>In more technical terms, The Internet of Things (IoT), refers to those devices that are equipped to sense the various aspects of the real world and are capable to not only collect and report the data about these aspects but also act on the information thus acquired. The real world aspects that these devices can judge include temperatures, light, motion and even the presence and absence of people and objects.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding The Impact of IoT On our Lives</strong></p>
<p><strong> <a href="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1922" src="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2-1024x604.jpg" alt="2" width="650" height="383" /></a></strong></p>
<p>The very concept of IoT is so fascinating that it has often been referred to as the futuristic way of living. In fact, IoT can be imagined as this huge network in which things are connected to each other and where things can refer to both people and devices. With this technology, a larger percentage of information would not only be produced by machines but even used by them with the single goal of improving the quality of our lives.</p>
<p>Imagine how easy your life would be if your Refrigerator could keep track of the of food stored inside it and alert you when you are running out of some things like milk or eggs etc. Another example can be that of a smart medicine cabinet alerting the owners about when their medicines need to be purchased or even better ordering refills from a connected drugstore.</p>
<p>The possibilities of using IoT for enhancing our standard of living are endless, especially if we look at the broader picture of national and global interests. It is being perceived that this technology can help in setting up advanced connectivity between devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine communications.</p>
<p><strong>When Will IoT Become A Reality</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1923" src="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3-1024x1024.jpg" alt="3" width="650" height="650" /></a>Well, in some respects, IoT is already a reality, although it is still being developed, tried and tested on a much smaller scale. In fact, there are various standalone applications and devices that implement the basic concept and philosophy of IoT.  However, before implementing this technology on a larger scale, the following issues need to be considered.</p>
<ul>
<li>The size of the network</li>
<li>Considerations related to space</li>
<li>Concerns about security</li>
<li>Choice of appropriate architecture</li>
<li>Ensuring proper connectivity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preparing For The IoT Revolution</strong></p>
<p>The Internet of Things is all set to change the world as we know it and the best way to prepare for the change is by enrolling in a course for the same. Given below are the brief details of some <strong>Free Online courses to learn IoT.</strong></p>
