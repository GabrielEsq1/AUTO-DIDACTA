<p>How many times have you felt unable to express your exact views on a topic or sought the help of your office pal in writing a great professional e-mail? There might be ample instances from your life when you might have felt the need to gain one or the other soft skill to enhance your personal and professional growth.  The best way to overcome this sense of dependence, and bring out your best aspects as an individual, is to enroll for one of the numerous personality development courses available online.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Personality Development Courses</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1929 size-full" src="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/21.jpg" alt="2" width="650" height="334" /></a> </strong></p>
<p>No matter how smart of intelligent you are, the lack of a strong and appealing personality can prove to be the biggest hindrance in the path of your career growth. In fact, the one common and significant change that the recruitment processes in various industries have witnessed over the past couple of decades is the focus on a well developed personality along with professional qualifications and skills.</p>
<p>Personality development programs are designed to develop and improve your inherent soft skills that can help you become a better individual. These courses are generally designed by professionals who understand the importance of various soft skills and have experience in handling individuals needing a helping hand with such skills.</p>
<p>Depending upon their current personality level, individuals might need to undertake multiple courses and programs that can enable them to attain the spiritual, physical and career objectives they aim for.  Therefore it is quite natural that these courses hold different meanings for different individuals and the type of course you should opt for is based on the traits that you admire in people who you feel are leading a better life.</p>
<p><strong>Who Needs Personality Development Courses</strong></p>
<p><strong> <a href="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1930" src="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31-1024x768.jpg" alt="3" width="650" height="488" /></a></strong></p>
<p>Personality development courses have no longer remained an option in the modern times. Rather they have become integral to the growth process of an individual and help them to identify challenges and find the solutions for the same in their everyday behavior patterns and attitudes. These programs are necessary for any individual, who feel the need to make an effective change in themselves to make the best of their environment and situations. In short, if you find yourself looking up to someone for any quality or trait that has helped him/her improve his/her position in life, then you definitely qualify as a likely candidate for a personality development program. <strong><em>      </em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The <a href="http://education.wolfram.com/">Wolfram Education Portal</a> is a fantastic resource for learning both basic and advanced math skills. The Algebra and Calculus courses currently offered should be helpful for individual online learners. The main benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Membership is free, giving access to comprehensive <a title="free math courses" href="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/2010/12/online-math-courses-video/">math courses</a> at your fingertips for no cost.</li>
<li>Concepts are presented in a variety of ways, so that every learning style is accommodated. Those who learn by reading will find the textbook portions easy. Those who learn visually and by doing will get the greatest benefit out of the <a title="math demonstrations" href="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/2011/11/free-math-science-simulations-university-colorado/">widgets and demonstrations</a> included in the text.</li>
<li>There are resources not only for students and independent learners, but lesson plans for teachers as well!</li>
</ul>
<p>The site uses five types of resources:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://education.wolfram.com/samples/textbook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Textbooks:</a> Each lesson includes a relevant section of Wolfram’s digital textbook, explaining the big concepts behind the chapter in easy-to-understand language. It’s very different from the math textbooks you may be used to! They also include comprehensive examples, explaining each new concept and problem step-by-step. Interactive widgets and demonstrations follow each section, described in more detail below. All this is followed by a review, which you would expect in a more traditional math class. This allows students to practice and apply what they’ve learned from the chapter. And, yes, you can check your answers once you’re done.</li>
<li><a href="http://education.wolfram.com/samples/lesson-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lesson Plans:</a> Wolfram also includes lesson plans that explain how to apply the textbook lesson in a lecture. These are intended for teachers, but are helpful for anyone who wants to learn a little more about the subject. There are class exercises to make sure everyone is following along, adding another level of understanding. There are some extra widgets in this section that you won’t find just reading the textbook.</li>
<li><a title="wolfram Education Demonstrations" href="http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demonstrations:</a> The demonstrations in the textbook show students how to visualize a problem. The demonstrations are interactive, meaning you can see how a problem would look if you substituted different numbers for the same problem. It shows students how dynamic the concepts really are, and effectively function as an unending series of related “examples” in a way a paper textbook just can’t match. &nbsp;Following subjects has demos.</li>
<li><a href="http://education.wolfram.com/samples/widget.html">Widgets:</a> The widgets are where the fun really comes in. Yes, I said it – Wolfram Education Portal manages to make math fun. You can play around with the concepts presented in the chapter, deepening your understanding. Unlike the demonstrations, the widgets are more flexible and show you how to solve actual problems, You can customize all the parameters, and it will output the results in a straightforward manner, just like the examples earlier in the chapter. This functions, in many ways, the same way as a teacher working a problem through on the board in front of the class. Obviously, this is a huge benefit for students who are using the site to study independently, or to build on a lesson previously taught in class.</li>
<li>Practice: This is the last feature Wolfram wants to bring to students. It’s not available yet, but hopefully will be soon. Practice will allow users to work out problems related to each lesson.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The last feature of Wolfram Education Portal is the only one that isn’t free. Wolfram also offers <a href="http://products.wolframalpha.com/courseassistants/">Course Assistant Apps</a> – unfortunately, presently available only for the <a title="iPhone app development tutorials" href="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/2011/07/mobile-application-development-courses/">iPhone</a>, iPod Touch, and iPad. These apps are very reasonably priced at less than $3 each, and they provide help in 13 different subjects. They cover not only basics like Pre-Algebra and Algebra, but several different Calculus courses, but also Physics, Statistics, and Chemistry. There’s even some really fun ones like Music Theory and <a title="Astronomy video tutorials" href="https://freevideolectures.com/Subject/Astronomy-Aerospace">Astronomy</a>!</p>
