				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What are the things generally on the minds of the average 18-19 year old teenagers? Well they could range from movies, hangouts, friends, relationships, exams and so on. But having big dreams, becoming trailblazers and driving the future- do they all sound far-fetched? Not at all, for some of those really passionate and zealous student entrepreneurs. Take for example Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page or Elon Musk. They share more than a few enviable accomplishments. They’re billionaires, they made their fortunes in technology and they started their businesses while they were still students apart from the fact they were also very smart.</p>
<p>So if you are quite keen and willing to take the dive, you don’t really have to wait until after graduation to launch your own business.</p>
<p>If you’re considering becoming a student entrepreneur, just like any other endeavor you undertake, you should have a clear plan. In the kind of competitive world we are in, it is essential to prepare the ground before getting into the battlefield. Researching the steps needed to successfully bootstrap a business from your dorm room is key.</p>
<p>Here are a some steps to Becoming a Successful Student Entrepreneur &amp; insights to the basics of starting up. At first, they look easy, but, as many student entrepreneurs will attest, it&#8217;s quite challenging, especially while juggling studies and work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Evaluate your business skills, knowledge and goals. Brainstorming is a great way to test your idea and make it even stronger.</li>
<li>Find the business idea that suits you and your skillset the best. Try to target a concept that taps into your existing skills and resources. Also as a student, your business idea should be relatively easy to manage and not consume a significant amount of your time.</li>
<li>Research your competitors (and prepare to crush them). Depending on your schedule and the amount of money you intend to earn, you may be better off choosing less popular markets that are easier to break into.</li>
<li>Make a stellar business plan. Your plan must be simple and require minimal start-ups costs, as otherwise you will simply incur additional debt.</li>
<li>Seek out a helpful mentor. It is always good to take advice when one is stuck through or needs a proper direction.</li>
<li>Once you have your fool-proof plan ready on paper, register your business, open up shop and rock it!</li>
<li>Any new task seems to be intimidating at first. It is important to not lose hope and stay positive throughout. You don’t have to be a professional to build a successful product. Remember amateurs started Google and Apple. Professionals built the Titanic. So just go for it and give it your best!</li>
</ol>
<p>From inception to launch, here’s how to start up while you’re still a student. Good luck!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For quite a while now, those on the receiving end of knowledge—students—have been neglected by both those who have the responsibility of teaching them and online educators on the subject of how students can increase their productivity/learning speed. Therefore, the bold step of looking into the student’s life and discussing tips on facing the stress of studying for that next test, and applicable time management techniques will be discussed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Top-5-tips.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1403 aligncenter" src="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Top-5-tips.jpg" alt="Productivity tips" width="530" height="391" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Education is Education</strong></h3>
<p>The average e-learner—adults included—rarely carry the educative mindset associated with a formal classroom to a virtual classroom and this anomaly is largely due to the informal setting associated with learning from the comfort of your home or office space. Therefore the first and most difficult challenge that impedes the e-learner is that of the mind also known as ‘the lack of motivation.’</p>
<p>The first step to fighting ‘learning fatigue’ is understanding the reasons why you registered for a module or <a title="free online courses" href="https://freevideolectures.com/free-college-courses-online/">online course</a>s. Was it by the behest of your parents or Boss? Or for your own personal development? The answer to these questions will go a long way in determining how beneficial the tips below will be to your educational pursuits. So please read on.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Redefine Your Goals:</strong> Once you have determined your reason of participating in an online program, the next step is to define your studying strategy to meet these goals. Therefore if you plan on just passing to get the required certification, then your study goals should lean towards using test materials to prepare for corresponding exams while if you are in for personal development, creating study strategies that incorporate that education into your daily life is the tip that should be considered by you</li>
<li><strong>Create your Learning Culture:</strong> the phrase ‘learning timetable’ wasn’t used here for we all know how unruly those things are. Its replacement ‘learning culture’ means studying how your brain assimilates and tailoring all your learning activities around those assimilation periods. Therefore if you are a morning or evening person, it is important that you take advantage of your learning personality/period by ensuring that educational inclined tasks occur around your most efficient periods since e-learning gives you the needed time flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Set Achievable Goals:</strong> I believe most students know or have heard about the benefits of setting small goals that can be achieved within a limited time duration and if you fall into the category of students in–the-know, it is really something you should consider integrating into your study schedule. The innovative tip here is to start an ‘achievable goals’ campaign—such as studying for a test or building an app/3Dmodel/circuit board etc.— having a time span under a month, focus on your strategy of achieving that goal and then crosschecking the results of your achievement against results gotten without the aid of a personal goal. The difference is surely destined to change your work ethic and approach to learning.</li>
<li><strong>Employ Collaborative Tools:</strong> the difficulties associated with having your course materials spread amongst diverse platforms—mail addresses, LMS, MOOC platforms etc.—and multiple devices—PC, tablets, phones having different operating systems—makes the task of learning a nightmare. Therefore to increase your productivity, it is essential that you make use of tools that collaborate the efforts of one another. Whether you are an Apple or Google fan boy/girl, the tip here is to ensure continuity between your devices and online accounts, so you can access your materials at any time using all your devices.</li>
<li><strong>Always Take Notes:</strong> Google Keep, Microsoft’s Stick Notes, <a title="Using Evernote at School" href="https://freevideolectures.com/blog/2012/01/evernote-school/">Evernote</a>, Samsung’s S Memo etc. are just a few of the note pads available to users of diverse devices looking to store information titbits for further research. The popularity of these productivity tools only goes to show that regardless of your career or professional line, there is always something new to learn each day and for students, the ‘something new’ to learn are usually much over a short period of time. Therefore keeping track of these new ideas and information while paying attention to your studies can easily be done using the electronic note pads synonymous to your devices.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, it is important to note that every tip provided here is designed as a support system to the most important factors needed to achieve success in any field which are constantly practicing and making your educational goals one of central parts of your life.</p>
